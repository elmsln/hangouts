# LRN Developer Hangout February 11, 2019

## Topics of Discussion

- Storybook fixed in WCFactory
- Open WC website and tooling https://open-wc.org/
- WC Library Starter repo https://github.com/emolr/wc-library-starter
- Workflows with custom theming in HAX sites
- React Hooks in Web Components https://github.com/matthewp/haunted


## Notes

- Webpack compilation errors in Storybook
 - Code Sample includes hightlight.js project so that it works with a type of module system.  It was failing on Storybook compilation.
 - A lot of 3rd party plugins are failing because it's multiple levels of compilations which could be in different formats.
 - Bryan wrote https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/es-global-bridge/es-global-bridge.js to try to solve some of these issues.  It allows you to use some global definitions in es6 module components.
  - used in aframe and anyang components.
