## Topics of Discussion

- Open WC website and tooling https://open-wc.org/
- WC Library Starter repo https://github.com/emolr/wc-library-starter
- Workflows with custom theming in HAX sites
- React Hooks in Web Components https://github.com/matthewp/haunted


## Notes

- Webpack compilation errors in Storybook
 - Code Sample includes hightlight.js project so that it works with a type of module system.  It was failing on Storybook compilation.
 - A lot of 3rd party plugins are failing because it's multiple levels of compilations which could be in different formats.
 - Bryan wrote https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/es-global-bridge/es-global-bridge.js to try to solve some of these issues.  It allows you to use some global definitions in es6 module components.
  - used in aframe and anyang components.

- We fixed Storybook in WCFactory :)
 - preinstall script, it prevents Storybook from entering into infinite loops.
 - WCFactory will autogenerate storybook files. It's guessing what the properties and values should be.  If you are doing anything slightly advanced then you would want to modify the storybook file in the element.
 - We are going to explore the best workflow is for publishing the Storybook.
 - Possible workflow
  - Develop in element: `cd elements/lrn-button && yarn serve`
